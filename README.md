- **🔓 Legal loopholes** - How to camp legally (private land, designated areas, etc.)
- **💡 Stealth camping tips** - The art of "parking overnight"
- **📍 Best free/cheap spots** - Curated locations with GPS coordinates

## The Reality

| Country | Status | Enforcement |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| 🇸🇮 Slovenia | Illegal | Strict |
| 🇭🇷 Croatia | Illegal | Very strict |
| 🇧🇦 Bosnia | Gray zone | Rarely enforced |
| 🇷🇸 Serbia | Gray zone | Relaxed |
| 🇲🇪 Montenegro | Illegal | Location-dependent |
| 🇦🇱 Albania | Wild West | Non-existent |

## Golden Rule

> "Parking" overnight is legal almost everywhere. "Camping" (tables, awnings, obviously living there) is what gets you fined.
